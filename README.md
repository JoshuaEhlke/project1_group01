# Group One Project: Correlation Between Mental Health and Music Preferences
🌍 **Overview**
This project investigates the relationship between mental health and music preferences. We analyze various factors, such as age, genre preferences, streaming service usage, and mental health concerns, to uncover meaningful insights. By leveraging data analytics tools and visualization techniques, our goal is to explore the potential impacts of music on mental well-being.

📂 **Dataset**

**Dataset Overview**
Our dataset explores the correlation between mental health and music preferences, focusing on factors such as:

👶👩‍🦳 Age

🎧 Music genre

📱 Streaming service usage

🧠 Types of mental health concerns

**Reason for Choosing the Dataset**
Mental health is a critical societal topic, and its intersection with music is deeply personal and impactful. This dataset allows us to investigate these areas meaningfully. Furthermore, team members with experience in music and mental health fields add valuable perspectives and relevance to our goals.

💡 **Inspiration**

We drew inspiration from a similar exploratory analysis on Kaggle:

**Source**: Music & Mental Health EDA

**Key Elements**:

Utilized tools like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, which align with techniques we have learned.

**Specific Focus Areas**:

Building upon insights by examining contributors' ages, preferred genres, streaming services, and mental health concerns.

❓**Research Questions**

How does listening to music influence mental health outcomes, and what factors determine whether the effects are improved, worsened, or have no effect?

How does the number of hours spent listening to music daily affect mental health?

Does age influence the mental health impact of listening to certain music genres?

📊 **Visualizations**

To present our findings effectively, we planned the following visualizations:

**Pie Chart**: Distribution of preferred music streaming services.

**Scatter Plot**: Correlation between average age and mental health concerns.

**Donut Chart**: The effects on mental health concerns paired with music.

**Boxplot**: Comparing the listening frequency between genres. 

**Violin Plot**: Variance in mental health concerns by scores.

**Correlation Matrix**: Visualizing relationships between listening habits and mental health metrics.

**Regression Plot**: The correlation between rock and depression. 

**T-Test**: To determine if there was a significant difference between the younger age groups to the older age groups. 


🎨 **Color Theme**

We selected a cohesive color palette to ensure consistency and visual appeal:

Primary Colors:

Deep Green (#264653)

Teal (#2A9D8F)

Yellow (#E9C46A)

Orange (#F4A261)

Red (#E76F51)

👥 **Roles & Responsibilities**

Each team pair is responsible for creating and refining multiple visualizations:

**Josh and Dominique**:

Donut Chart (effects of music on mental healh)

Pie Chart (music streaming services)

Violin Plot (mental health concerns distribution)

Regression Plot (Correlation between rock and depression)

**Georgina and Gina**:

Scatter Plot ( average age vs. mental health)

Box Plot (frequency of listening between genres)

Correlation Matrix (listening habits vs. mental health indicators)

T-Test (comparison of age groups vs. mental health)
